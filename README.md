# chervil
A detection algorithm for human endogenous retroviral expression features that correspond to viral infection. 

## What is chervil?
Human endogenous retroviral (hERV) elements are typically latent in the human genome. However, previous work suggests that transcription of certain hERVs is activated upon new viral infection. In an exploratory effort to develop novel diagnostic tools for pre-symptomatic or historic infection detection, #chervil uses short read expression data (e.g. RNA-seq) to identify hERVs that are up-regulated concurrently or historically with specific viral infections.
